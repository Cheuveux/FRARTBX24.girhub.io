            <h2>What is your relationship with CSS ? Do you consider yourself as a designer, amateur, thinker, artist ? </h2>
            <p>As a student of logic and philosophy of science I am specially interested in the relationship between logical and mathematical theories and computer science. As a part of my master's degree in Paris 1 Panth√©on Sorbonne, I wrote a first memory on explaining fundamental concepts of programming languages with  logics theories. Led by curiosity and as I read articles and theorical  manuals, I began to learn programming languages. 
            </p>
            <p> In order to answer all the questions I was asking to myself I had to learn how to construct objects on web.Learning CSS become a mandatory step when I discovered this weird looking language which don't look like any one else I discovered (neitheir imperative nor functionnal). Quickly few friends asked me to code their website or simple projects for school, and gave me the occasion to explore CSS more deeply.</p>
            <p>
              I was strike at first by the amount of precision it allows to the user to recreate the interface he imagines. It allows everyone to display freely and clearly anyhting they want, and plays a key role in collective organisation through nuerical spaces (simply by at all the free-access documentation avaible on the web). Then CSS appears, despite its minimal syntax, to display a strong  interraction from simple to complex numerical object, non being only limited to the web. Thus it becomes  a main object of the numerical space I am dived in. 
            </p>

        <section id="R2"> <h2>How does CSS maniefst in your practices, can you give some examples of projects where it took a particular role ?</h2>
        <p>
            Because I only disocvered CSS six months ago as an amateur I am still exploring the power of expression contained in this language, keeping to code projects where CSS occupied a main role. It appears to be a must have programming language, from simple e-commerce and webshop to more artistic and purely expressive content. The distinctions between those two types of web objects, and all the concepts they embodie, were made concrete by CSS. What a wild discovery. At the  moment I am helping a friend of mine who is studying photography and needs a website to expose his a work. 
        </p>
        <p>Creating a such webpage implies a huge work on styling content in order to highlight the pictures. This projects is far away from designign texts, but is about designing screen spaces of various sizes.</p>
        <p>Here I learn that CSS is not only made for designign text but is a language provided for creating new space of free expression in this blank interface. Moreover, designig space and worlds only by writing declarations appears furisously exciting for me. Indeed, CSS, without any form of calculus, makes concrete any imaginable space I can figure out at least I declared it well...  </p>

        <section id="R3"><h2>Do you have other practices, such as writing, poerty, installation or performances that you feel can be interwined with the borader artistic aspect of the worksession ?</h2>
            <p> Exploring programming languages through various aspects are one of my practices which seems relevant for this worksession. 
            </p>
            <p>For the sake of the resarch around my memory I am trying to question the singularity of each programmaing languages, which can be considered as singular entities, or as groups (mostly functionnal, imperative and declarative) based  on logical and mathematicals groundings.  </p>
            <p> Although, all this resarch is not only mathematical based, but it is driven by a philosophical reflexion about reasoning and languages. Indeed, looking for classyfing different groups of programming languages implies a conceptual definitional work which is proprely philosophical and demands to be constantly questionned. That is why I examine concepts as "algorithm", "declaration", "compiling" or "instructions" and try to return a plural level of interpretations of those.</p>
            <p>Moreover I work a lot with programming languages for my own sake, in order to explore sounds for instance. Indeed, I create some programs about sound decoder and analysis with the Python library called "librosa". My goal is to publish those programs formulated on a web interface, where CSS won't be an option.

        <section id="R4"><h2> What is your experience in collective work ?</h2>
            <p> I have done differents form of collective works in my experience. 
            First of all, as apart of my studies I am used to collective research and redactions on various topics. It goes from analysis of scientific articles, to discussions on philosophical and scientific concepts such as knowledge form the point of view of neuroscience, or aestethics in mathematics. Those worksessions were consisting of finding the right balance between technical and scientific knowledges and philosophical questions wich can help to understand those knowledges with great pluralism.   </p>
        <p>Moreover, some acquiantances of mine organized collective exhibitions where I participated for scenography and installation of the space in conventional galleries or in a garage, even in undeground galleries. Specially those last were marked by the power of the emulation of collective reflexion and by the importance of plurality of pojnts of view about a same object, or a same space. </p>
        <p>Even if I am still not involve in a collective work in programming project, I begin to use Github to facilitate the communication and organisation of my works.Consequently, I am prepared for an eventual one because I know how to use this plateform made for facilitating collective works in programming. </p>
