            <h2>What is your relationship with CSS ? Do you consider yourself as a designer, amateur, thinker, artist ? </h2>
            <p>As a student of logic and philosophy of science I am specially interested in the relationship between logical and mathematical theories . As a part of my master's degree in Paris 1 Panth√©on Sorbonne, I wrote a first memory on explaining fundamental concepts of programming language with logics theories.
            </p>
            <p> In order to answer all the questions I was asking to myself I had to learn how to construct objects on web.Learning CSS become a mandatory step when I discovered this weir looking language which don't look like any one else I discovered (neitheir imperative nor functionnal). Quickly few friends asked me to code their website or simple projects for school, and gave me the occasion to explore CSS more deeply.</p>
            <p>
                Because I only disocvered CSS six months ago as an amateur I am still exploring the power of expression contained in this language, keeping to code projects for my fiends and while considering this language by abstraction in logical and syntacxical formalism.

        <section id="R2"> <h2>How does CSS maniefst in your practices, can you give some examples of projects where it took a particular role ?</h2>
        <p>
          As an amateur and a student I am coding fduring my free-time. At the  moment I am helping a friend of mine who is studying photography and needs a website to expose his a work. 
        </p>
        <p>Creating a such webpage implies a huge work on styling content in order to highlight the pictures. This projects is far away from designign texts, but is about designing screen spaces of various sizes.</p>
        <p>Here I learn that CSS is not only made for designign text but is a tool for creating new space of free expression in this blank interface. Moreover, designig space and worlds only by writing declarations appears furisously exciting for me. Indeed, CSS makes concrete any imaginable space I can figure out at least I declared it wel...  </p>

        <section id="R3"><h2>Do you have other practices, such as writing, poerty, installation or performances that you feel can be interwined with the borader artistic aspect of the worksession ?</h2>
            <p> Exploring programming languages through various aspects are one my practices which seems relevant for this worksession. 
            </p>
            <p>Indeed as a part of the resarch around my memory I am trying to question the singularity of each programmaing languages, whichc can be considered as singular entites, or as groups (mostly functionnal, imperative and declarative) on logical and mathematicals groundings.  </p>
            <p> CSS, perhpas it is free from calculus and necessarily limited to formatting tasks, is still a programming language from a strict logical and mathematical point of view and should not be reduced at a simple tool for this reason.</p>

        <section id="R4"><h2> What is your experience in collective work ?</h2>
            <p> I got multiple experiences in collective works.
            </p>
        <p>Indeed,</p>
