            <h2>What is your relationship with CSS ? Do you consider yourself as a designer, amateur, thinker, artist ? </h2>
            <p>As a student of logic and philosophy of science I am specially interested in the relationship between logical and mathematical theories and computer science. As a part of my master's degree in Paris 1 Panth√©on Sorbonne, I wrote a first memory on explaining fundamental concepts of programming language with  logics theories.
            </p>
            <p> In order to answer all the questions I was asking to myself I had to learn how to construct objects on web.Learning CSS become a mandatory step when I discovered this weir looking language which don't look like any one else I discovered (neitheir imperative nor functionnal). Quickly few friends asked me to code their website or simple projects for school, and gave me the occasion to explore CSS more deeply.</p>
            <p>
                Because I only disocvered CSS six months ago as an amateur I am still exploring the power of expression contained in this language, keeping to code projects where CSS occupied a main role, while considering this language by philosophical abstraction in logical and syntacxical formalism.
            </p>

        <section id="R2"> <h2>How does CSS maniefst in your practices, can you give some examples of projects where it took a particular role ?</h2>
        <p>
          As an amateur and a student I am coding during my free-time. At the  moment I am helping a friend of mine who is studying photography and needs a website to expose his a work. 
        </p>
        <p>Creating a such webpage implies a huge work on styling content in order to highlight the pictures. This projects is far away from designign texts, but is about designing screen spaces of various sizes.</p>
        <p>Here I learn that CSS is not only made for designign text but is a language provided for creating new space of free expression in this blank interface. Moreover, designig space and worlds only by writing declarations appears furisously exciting for me. Indeed, CSS, without any form of calculus, makes concrete any imaginable space I can figure out at least I declared it well...  </p>

        <section id="R3"><h2>Do you have other practices, such as writing, poerty, installation or performances that you feel can be interwined with the borader artistic aspect of the worksession ?</h2>
            <p> Exploring programming languages through various aspects are one my practices which seems relevant for this worksession. 
            </p>
            <p>For the skae of the resarch around my memory I am trying to question the singularity of each programmaing languages, which can be considered as singular entities, or as groups (mostly functionnal, imperative and declarative) based  on logical and mathematicals groundings.  </p>
            <p> Perhaps, all this resarch is not only mathematical based, but it is "sous-tendu" by a philosophical reflexion about reasoning and languages. Indeed, looking for classyfing diffenrt groups of programming languages implies a conceptual definition work which is proprely philosophical and demands to be constantly questionned.</p>
            <p>Moreover I work a lot with programming languages for my own sake, in order to explore sounds for instance. Indeed, I create some programs about sound decoder and analysis with the Python library called "librosa". My goal is to publishe those programs on the web, wich can be better formulated due to CSS.  </p>

        <section id="R4"><h2> What is your experience in collective work ?</h2>
            <p> I have done differents form of collective works in my experience. 
            </p>
            <p>First of all, as apart of my studies I am used to collective research and redactions on various topics. It goes from analysis of scientific articles, to discussions on philosophical and scientific concepts sucha as knowledge form the point of view of neuroscience, or language abroad from the study of programming languages.</p>
        <p>Moreover, some acquiantances of mine organized exhibitions where I participated for scenography and installation of the space. This experience of collective work helps me to figure out how plural points of view can find an agreement, and all work together.</p>
        <p>Even if I am still not involve in a collective work in programming project, I begin to use Github to facilitate the communication of my works. That is why I am prepared for an eventual one because I know how to use this plateform made for facilitating collective works in programming. </p>
